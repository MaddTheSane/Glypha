Description from MacUpdate:

> Glypha III is a classic arcade game originally created by John Calhoun in which you are placed inside an Egyptian temple with only your lance and a winged steed to aid you. Here you are forced to do battle with Sphinxes in order to gain the honour of a place on the High Scores list. The game is based on Joust and features sound and the original animated graphics.
