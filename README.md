This is an in-progress (and very slow) port of Glypha III from its OS X Carbon/QuickDraw version (~1995) to OpenGL/cross platform.

In early 2009 I sloppily ported the game to Cocoa/OpenGL in about a week, but this is a do-over to help me learn OpenGL and cross platform development.

Current targets are Cocoa and Win32, but long term goals are Linux, Haiku (BeOS), iOS (iPad only, iPhone version already exists), Windows RT, and Android.

Description from MacUpdate:

> Glypha III is a classic arcade game originally created by John Calhoun in which you are placed inside an Egyptian temple with only your lance and a winged steed to aid you. Here you are forced to do battle with Sphinxes in order to gain the honour of a place on the High Scores list. The game is based on Joust and features sound and the original animated graphics.
